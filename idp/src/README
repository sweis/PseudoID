A private OpenID Provider application for Google App Engine. The implementation
is modified from the sample OpenID Provider included here:

http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-samples/.

For more about OpenID, see:
  http://openid.net/
  http://openid.net/about.bml

Uses JanRain's Python OpenID library, version 2.2.4, licensed under the 
Apache Software License 2.0:

To run the private IDP, run the dev_appserver on the project directory (which
contains the app.yaml file):

python path/to/dev_appserver.py path/to/project/src/ --port 9999

The IDP's front page has further directions on how to login under a created
nickname.

The JanRain library includes a reference OpenID consumer that can be used to
test this provider. That consumer is included here for your convenience. To run
the sample consumer run

  python src/consumer.py --port 8001

Then go to http://localhost:8001/ in your browser, type in
http://localhost:9999/server as your openid identifier, and click Verify.

The JanRain library includes a reference OpenID consumer that can be used to
test this provider. After starting the dev_appserver with this app, unpack the
JanRain library and run these commands from its root directory:

  setenv PYTHONPATH .
  python ./examples/consumer.py -s localhost

Then go to http://localhost:8001/ in your browser, type in
http://localhost:8080/server as your openid identifier, and click Verify.

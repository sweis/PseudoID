You can use this private identity provider to anonymously log into any 
website that supports <nobr><a href="http://openid.net/">
 <img src="/static/openid-icon.png"/>OpenID</a></nobr>! 
 Just follow these simple steps.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Create a nickname or pseudonym at the 
    <a href="http://blind-signer.appspot.com">PseudoID Blind Signer</a>.
  </li>
  
  <li> Visit any OpenID-enabled website and enter 
<span class="url">{{ request_url_without_path }}/server</span> as your OpenID. Try these:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.puffypoodles.com/">Puffypoodles</a>: 
          Google Step2 Demo
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/trunk/examples/consumer/">
          JanRain Consumer</a>: Python OpenID Example Consumer
       </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.plaxo.com/openid">Plaxo</a>: 
          Social Networking Site
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    You're Done! You'll be logged in under your nickname.
  </li>
</ol>

  How It Works
</div>

<p> 
  The PseudoID private identity provider authenticates users anonymously by
  piggbyacking on the PseudoID blind signer.
    
    When you create a nickname at the blind signer, you are asked to login
  normally using your google account. Once the blind signer knows that you are
  a valid user, it issues you an access token with your chosen nickname.
  
    The token is blindly signed by the signer such that PseudoID will later
  recognize it as being created by a valid user, but will not be able to tell
  <i>which</i> user created the token.
